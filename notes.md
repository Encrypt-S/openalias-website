# Notes

Didn't add social icons to the footer because I don't have the icons and it's duplicate content, the social links are literall next to them why do we need double ups?
  
Removed FAQ from the footer because we already have a link to the FAQ on this site in the menu
  
On `VerifyNewAddress` and `VerifyPrevAddress` pages the instruction step text isn't centered because the styling would need a rewrite, a hack or a new component in order to do this. I'm no CSS wizard though.
