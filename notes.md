# Notes

## Things to do

- Approve and merge this PR https://github.com/Encrypt-S/openalias-website/pull/21
- Add text to Privacy Policy and Ts and Cs pages https://github.com/Encrypt-S/openalias-website/issues/19
- Add proper error handling for network errors https://github.com/Encrypt-S/openalias-website/issues/15
- The PR linked above fixes [this issue here[(https://github.com/Encrypt-S/openalias-website/issues/17) to a point but doesn't have the proper popover that the design specifies, so if we want to get that pop up added for MVP then we need to add it 
- Final testing and a check to make sure the copy is correct https://github.com/Encrypt-S/openalias-website/issues/18

## Things I didn't do on purpose

I haven't added the on hover pop-ups to the text input errors because I didn't have time to get it done before I left Berlin and couldn't figure out how to do it on the plane.

Didn't add social icons to the footer because I don't have the icons and it's duplicate content, the social links are literall next to them why do we need double ups?
  
Removed FAQ from the footer because we already have a link to the FAQ on this site in the menu
  
On `VerifyNewAddress` and `VerifyPrevAddress` pages the instruction step text isn't centered because the styling would need a rewrite, a hack or a new component in order to do this imo. I'm no CSS wizard though.
